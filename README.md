## 🧪 Executing Unit Tests
Describe the detailed steps to build and execute all of your unit tests from the command line (terminal / console). Your user may not have an IDE installed.
## 📚 Reviewing Unit Test Coverage
Note the coverage achieved in your Calculator Logic module and include a screenshot of your coverage graphic from your JetBrains IDE. Your calculator logic must achieve 100% test coverage of all statements and paths.
## 🎞️ Executing End-To-End Tests
Describe the detailed steps to build and execute all of your end-to-end unit tests from the command line (terminal / console). Your user may not have an IDE installed.

Finally, include sample output in a code block.
## 🎥 Final Video Presentation
Include a link to your final video presentation. If the file is checked into your Team Repository, this will be a relative link. Otherwise, it will be a fully-qualified link to YouTube or Vimeo.
